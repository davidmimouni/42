-- Game ----------------------------------------------------------------------->
The game class is the core of the program.
It contains all the informations that every part of the game need to work.
	The name;
	The size of the map;
	The value of each cardinal point as bitwise operator (Yes we are in space
	but let's say it the astral North Pole we are pointing).

The private atribut _map contains the map of the game;
The _active attribut contains the first player.

You can set the public static Verbose to True to see some debugging stuff.

The map is initiated with contruct (calling the private method init map).

Public method looser checks if the players still have their spaceships.

Public method add_player... Adds a player.

Public method add_ship... Add a ship in the direction and with the coordinates
you ask

Public method del_ship... Delete the ship it has in params.
